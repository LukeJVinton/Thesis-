% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

% I would like to acknowledge help and support (technical and moral) from many people, in many forms since 2009. I would not have been able to
% complete this work without my supervisors, Antonella De Santo and Fabrizio Salvatore. I always enjoyed working with Anthony Rose and learnt
% a lot from him, as well as the other Sussex ATLAS students: Nicky Santoyo, Ed Leming, Zara Grout and Yusufu Shehu. Tina Potter was always
% there to help with easy and difficult questions. Valeria Bartsch and Emyr James both helped me with various tasks. It was a pleasure to work
% in the ATLAS multilepton SUSY group: Sam King, Steve Farrell, Basil Schneider, Lukas Marti, Tobias Kruker, Sigve Haug, Anadi Canepa and
% Zoltan Gecse all deserve special mention. I learnt a great deal from the UK students at CERN, and particularly my neighbours and
% pseudo-neighbours from \textit{Rue de l'Athen\'ee}: Will Buttinger, Caterina Doglioni, Nick Edwards, Jack Goddard, Robert King, Adrian
% Lewis, Sarah Livermore, Bryn Mathias, James Robinson, Ailsa Sparkes and Chris Young. Many members of the ATLAS collaboration (too many to
% mention) also gave me the benefit of their time and expertise. Finally, I would like to thank Ellie Davies and my parents.
