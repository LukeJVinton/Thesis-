%\subsection{History of Neutrino Physics}

\section{The Standard Model}

Our current understanding of particle physics is well described by the Standard model, which describes the interactions between fundamental particles and the weak, electromagnetic and strong forces.



\subsection{The Weak Force}

Neutrinos interact with matter through the weak force in one of three flavour eigenstates (electron, muon or tau). The weak force is mediated by the electrically charged W$^{\pm}$ and electrically neutral Z bosons.

A neutrino interacting with matter through the W boson will produce a charged lepton corresponding to the weak flavour of the incoming neutrino. 
This process can happen in reverse, with a charged lepton producing a neutrino with the same flavour and a W boson. Such processes involving a W boson are known as charged current interactions (CC interactions).
