%Introduce the following chapter
This chapter presents an overview of the methodology of the second
muon neutrino disappearance analysis. 
The methodology represents the chain starting with raw detector hits
and ending with the sensitivity and result contours. Particular focus
is given to components of the analysis chain for which the author made
a significant contribution.
The second disappearance analysis summary~\cite{SASummary} and the
second analysis disappearance paper~\cite{NOvASA} are both used as
references throughout. 


\section{Event Reconstruction}\label{sec:reco}

The reconstruction begins with a collection of above threshold APD
signals clustered in space and time~\cite{baird2015analysis,
  ester1996density}. 
These collections of APD signals are used to reconstruct event
candidates~\cite{baird2015analysis}.
The trajectories of charged particles within an event are
reconstructed using a technique based on the Kalman filter
algorithm~\cite{kalman1960new}~\cite{KalmanTrackNote}. An example
far detector event with tracks found using the NOvA Kalman filter is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:recoTrackEvd}.  
The top and bottom halves of the Figure show the x and y-view
of the detector respectively. 
Histograms of the hit time and hit charge are shown at the bottom left
and right respectively.
The reconstructed tracks are each indicated by the different coloured
lines. 

The NOvA Kalman tracker is used to estimate the true trajectory of a
particle within the detector given positions of cell
hits within an event. 
Trackable particles are characterised by trajectories with long 
straight sections, dominated by small angle multiple scattering, and
intermittent large scattering angles caused by electromagnetic or
strong interactions~\cite{KalmanTrackNote}. 
The track finding process initially starts from the downstream end of
the detector, where particles emerging from a NuMI interaction will
(on average) be the most separated, and proceeds upstream. 
Track finding and fitting is performed separately in each detector
view since the trajectory in each view is independent. Later the views
are matched to reconstruct three dimensional tracks~\cite{KalmanTrackNote}. 
% This matching of views also presents an opportunity to recover tracks
% reconstructed as multiple separate tracks due to hard
% scattering.

\section{Selection and Background}\label{sec:sel}

A series of selection packages are used to identify charged-current
muon neutrino events within the detector and also to reject background
events. 
The two main sources of background to the muon neutrino
disappearance analysis are cosmic ray muons and beam induced
backgrounds including neutral current, $\nu_e$ charged current
and $\nu_\tau$ charged current events. 
The good spill, data quality, cosmic, containment and reconstructed
particle identification selection packages are described in the
following paragraph. 

% beam bkg and cosmics
The beam background events are estimated using the simulation for each
detector.
Events passing the selection but failing a truth cut
requiring a muon or anti-muon neutrino are deemed to be
background. 
The cosmic background (mostly secondary cosmic ray muons) is estimated
using two samples of far detector data which occur outside of the beam
spill window.  
The first sample is taken using the timing sidebands of the data
collected with the NuMI trigger. This sample matches the exposure of the
detector to the NuMI beam but the shape of the neutrino energy
distribution is statistically limited.
The second sample is taken using a cosmic trigger where data is
collected for activity within the detector outside of the beam-spill window.
This second sample contains more events and provides a better shape
but does not match the far detector exposure.
% intro. cut flow
Figure~\ref{fig:cosCutFlow} shows the estimated number of cosmic
background and signal events after each successive selection is
applied to the sample.
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cosCutFlow}, selections are made for good
spills, data quality, cosmic rejection, containment and neutral
current rejection. 
%good spills
The first selection, at the top of Figure~\ref{fig:cosCutFlow}, is the
good spill selection which requires that the
NuMI beam is produced within acceptable bounds of spill time ($< 0.5
\times 10^9~\text{seconds}$), 
spill POT ($> 2 \times 10^{12}$), 
horn current ($-202~\text{kA} < I < -198~\text{kA}$), proton beam
position on NuMI target ($-2~\text{mm} < pos(x,y) < 2~\text{mm}$) and
beam width ($0.57~\text{mm} < width(x,y) <1.58~\text{mm}$)
\cite{NOvASADAQ}~\cite{NOvAFABeamMon}. 

% selection cutflow plot

  \caption{The number of signal events (red) and cosmic background
    events (yellow) surviving each successive analysis selection. The
    signal is estimated from the simulation and the cosmic background
    is estimated from the timing sidebands of the NuMI trigger. Figure
    taken from~\cite{NOvANumuSABless}.
  } 
  \label{fig:cosCutFlow}
p\end{figure}


%explain data quality
Next, the data quality selection removes events with problems in one
or more data concentrator modules. 
The selection requires that: no data concentrator modules completely
drop out during the spill, tracks do not all stop at DCM edge
boundaries (this signals that the detector is out of sync and uses a
DCM edge metric~\cite{DCMEdgeMetric}), and
\textcolor{red}{fracdcm3hits $< 0.45$. Where is this defined? Is there
  a technote?}.

% explain the cosmic BDT
The cosmic rejection selection utilises a boosted decision tree (BDT)
to create a cosmic rejection particle identification
variable~\cite{CosRejTechnote}. 
The BDT is passed 11 variables including the angle of the track
relative the NuMI beam direction, maximum height of activity within
the detector, length of the track and the number of hits.

%explain containment
A selection is made to ensure the events used for the analysis are
fully contained within the detector. This selection serves two
purposes, it ensures all the energy from a muon neutrino charged
current interaction is deposited within the detector. The selection
also assists the rejection of cosmic rays in the far detector and rock
muons (from interactions of neutrinos in the rock upstream of the
detector) in the near detector.
The containment selection uses both the kalman tracks reconstructed as
described in Section~\ref{sec:reco} and the hits to select fully
contained events.
The hit component of the selection requires that there are no hits in
the outer two cells in either view and also no hits in the first or last
two planes of the detector.
The track component of the selection
requires that the forward or backward projection from the end or start
of the kalman track passes through at least 10 cells before exiting
the detector. 

% near detector containment
The near detector has a slightly different selection to account for
the muon catcher and the relative absence of the cosmic ray muon
background. As described in Section~\ref{sec:neardet}, the
muon catcher at the downstream end of the near detector is 2/3 the
height of the fully active detector. 
The differences with respect to the far detector containment selection
are as follows. 
The projection cut is loosened to at least 4 planes projected forward
and at least 8 planes projected backwards. 
The start position of the
kalman track must occur in the fully active detector upstream of the
muon catcher. 
The kalman track must either end within the 
fully active detector or the position of the track within the detector
at transition from fully active to muon catcher must be below the
height of the muon catcher.~\cite{SASummary}

% explain the ReMId selection
A k-nearest neighbours (kNN) classifier~\cite{altman1992introduction}
known as Reconstructed Muon Identification (ReMId)
is used to identify muon candidates among the particle
trajectories within an event~\cite{raddatzThesis}. 
The Reconstructed Muon Identification algorithm uses the following
four variables to distinguish muons from pions using the kNN
classifier:  
dE/dx, scattering, track length and fraction of plains along the track
consistent with additional hadronic energy
depositions. The kNN output is a score for each event, the
distribution of ReMId scores is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:remidDist},
the muon neutrino charged current signal events are shown by the black
histogram which peaks close to 1 and the neutral current background
events are shown by the red histogram. 
For each event passing the preceding cuts, the particle with the
highest ReMId score is designated as the primary muon track.
Events with $\text{ReMId} > 0.75$ are taken as muon neutrino
charged current interactions, in the far detector this selection
results in a signal efficiency and purity for contained events of 81\%
and 95\% respectively. 
Where the impact of neutrino oscillations on the efficiency
and purity is approximately accounted for by setting $\Delta m^2_{32}
= 2.5 \times 10^{-3} \text{eV}^2$ and $\sin^2\theta_{23} =
0.5$~\cite{raddatzThesis}~\cite{remidNote}.

    from~\cite{remidNote}.  
  } 
  \label{fig:remidDist}
\end{figure}

% cvn selection
An alternative method called Convolutional Visual Network (CVN) for
selecting muon neutrino charged current events has recently been
developed. 
The CVN algorithm identifies muon neutrino charged current
events based on the event topology and does not require detailed event
reconstruction. 
The output from the muon neutrino charged current event classifier is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cvnDist}. The signal events are shown by the
blue histogram. The background neutral current, appearance $\nu_e$ and
inherent beam $\nu_e$ events are shown by the blue, purple and pink
histograms respectively.

\section{Calibration}\label{sec:calibration}

NOvA's energy calibration is performed in three stages.
The attenuation calibration corrects the detector response along the
NOvA cells using through going muons. The attenuation corrected
response should be uniform across the detector. 
The absolute energy calibration uses muons that stop within the
detector to find a constant to convert the attenuation correct
response into physically meaningful units of GeVs.
The drift calibration accounts and adjusts for the variation of the
detector response with time caused by seasonal effects and instrument
degradation. 


\subsection{Attenuation and Threshold Calibration}

The attenuation calibration uses the energy depositions of
through-going cosmic ray muons to produce constants and formulae such
that such that the corrected detector response to energy depositions
is uniform across the detector. 
Attenuation fits are performed on a channel by channel basis, in other
words the detector response along the length of each NOvA cell is
fitted to produce a calibration for that cell~\cite{alexAtten}. 

Before calibrating, the detector response is divided by the the
path-length (through a cell) to reduce the impact of variations in
path-length arising from reconstruction efficiencies of different
track angles. 
To provide an accurate path length estimation only hits which have
neighbouring hits from the same track in the two directly adjacent
cells within the same plane are used for the calibration. 
Using this selection allows the path-length
through a cell to be calculated from the cell width and the angle of
the track. 

Figure~\ref{fig:attenCurvND} shows the uncalibrated
detector response along the length of a NOvA near detector cell, data
and a fit to the data are shown by the black points and the blue curve
respectively. The fit to the data is used to provide constants that
correct the detector response within the cell such that the response
is uniform across the detector.~\cite{alexAtten}~\cite{prabAtten}

    statistical errors. A fit to the data is shown by the blue
    curve. Figure taken from~\cite{alexAtten}.\label{fig:attenCurvND}
  }  
\end{figure}


\subsection{Absolute Calibration}
% absolute calibration
The absolute calibration method is described in the first analysis
absolute calibration technical note~\cite{lukeAbsCal}. The results of the
second analysis calibration and the differences compared to the first
analysis are described in the second analysis absolute calibration
technical note~\cite{dianaAbsCal}.
The NOvA absolute calibration uses the energy deposited by stopping
muons as a standard candle. 
To reduce systematic uncertainties, only those
energy deposits in a 1-2 m window away from the muon track end point
are used. 
The mean of the detector response distribution is found for
data and MC in both near and far detectors. 
The mean of the distribution of true energy deposits in the track
window is used to provide a conversion factor between the detector
response and the true energy deposited in the scintillator for minimum
ionising muons.
Figure~\ref{fig:calibrateddEdx} shows the resulting calibrated dE/dx
distribution of stopping muons in NOvA's far
detector.~\cite{lukeAbsCal}

    Data and simulation are shown by the black points and red
    histogram respectively.
    Figure taken from~\cite{lukeAbsCal}.
  } 
  \label{fig:calibrateddEdx}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Drift Calibration}

A drift calibration is being developed to account for variations in
the detector response with time. At the point of writing this stage of
the calibration is not yet implemented.


\subsection{Timing Calibration}

The aim of the timing calibration is to precisely synchronise each
detector externally with the neutrino beam and internally among
the electronic detector components. 
The internal timing calibration measures and accounts for timing
offsets between data concentrator modules (see~\ref{sec:DAQ}) using
hit times from cosmic ray tracks crossing multiple data concentrator
modules.~\cite{evanTiming}



\section{Energy Reconstruction}

The neutrino energy is estimated with a resolution of approximately 7\%
from the muon and hadronic energy. 
The muon energy is estimated with a resolution of 3.5\% using the
length of the track within the detector.  
As a consequence, the energy of muon's that do not stop within the
detectors cannot be estimated with the same accuracy. 
The visible hadronic energy is estimated from the calibrated
detector response (see Section~\ref{sec:calibration}) of hits not
associated with the muon track. 
The simulation is used to create a conversion function from visible
hadronic energy to total hadronic energy using a linear fit. 
The total hadronic energy is estimated, with a resolution of 25\%,
from the visible energy using the conversion function.~\cite{NOvASA} 


\section{Extrapolation}\label{sec:extrap}
The NOvA near detector is used to compare distributions resulting from
neutrino interactions in data and simulation. Any significant
difference between the two means that a process exists that is not
correctly modelled in the simulation. 
The differences in the near detector neutrino energy spectrum between
data and simulation are extrapolated to predict the far detector
neutrino energy spectrum. The extrapolation accounts for neutrino
oscillations, acceptance differences and flux differences between the
near and far detector. 

The extrapolation proceeds in stages. 
First, simulation estimated background is subtracted from the the near
detector data spectrum.  
A reconstructed to true neutrino energy matrix obtained from the near
detector simulation is used to convert the background subtracted
reconstructed neutrino energy into a true energy spectrum. 
A far-to-near detector event ratio is used to account for the effect
of neutrino oscillations and the different acceptances of the two
detectors.
The true neutrino energy spectrum is multiplied by the far to near
event ratio as a function of true neutrino energy to produce the far
detector true neutrino energy spectrum.  The far detector
true neutrino energy is converted back to reconstructed
neutrino energy using the far detector reconstructed to true neutrino
energy matrix obtained from the far detector simulation. 
Finally, background events due to cosmic rays (from data) and beam
backgrounds (from MC) are added to the extrapolated far detector
reconstructed neutrino energy distribution to form a prediction that
will later be compared to the far detector data.
\cite{NOvASA}



\section{GENIE Tune}\label{sec:genietune}

% introduce 2p2h MEC
Recently other experiments have presented evidence suggesting an
additional process contributing to the neutrino interaction event
rate~\cite{rodrigues2016identification}. 
The distribution of hadronic
energy in the NOvA near detector data provides supporting evidence for
the additional process~\cite{tuftsWeightNote}. 
For the second analysis the simulation was adjusted to include a
semi-empirical model of the so called two-particle two-hole (2p2h)
process where 
neutrinos scatter from nucleon pairs within the nucleus via a meson
exchange current (MEC) between the nucleons.
The model is motivated by observations of a rate enhancement in
electron on nucleus scattering where the discrepency is modelled via
the additional 2p2h process including meson exchange
currents~\cite{benhar2008inclusive}. 

% Axial mass ($\text{M}_{\text{A}}$) gets included as a bodge to the
% cross section. $\text{M}_{\text{A}}$ should be 1~GeV. 
% If it is greater it indicates the existence of an extra process at
% that energy scale. 

% explain the CC QE cross section plot. Explain how the original MEC
% weight in genie is found from the difference between data and the
% free nucleon (M_A = 1~GeV) cross section.
Figure~\ref{fig:QEXSection_katori} shows the quasi-elastic cross
section vs. reconstructed neutrino energy for data taken with the
MiniBooNE (red circles) and the NOMAD (blue stars) experiments. The
MiniBooNE and NOMAD experiments measured the cross section for
neutrino interactions with reconstructed neutrino energy in the ranges
$0.4 - 2~\text{GeV}$ and $4 - 80~\text{GeV}$ respectively.
At low energy MiniBooNE data shows good agreement with the Fermi Gas
model with an axial mass of $1.35~\text{GeV}$. At higher energies
NOMAD data~\cite{lyubushkin2009study} shows good agreement with the
Fermi Gas model with an axial 
mass of $1.03~\text{GeV}$ (the free nucleon cross section). 
The NOMAD data indicates agreement with the free nucleon cross
section, implying the multi-nucleon process is not present at higher
energies. 
Therefore, the GENIE MEC cross section is set to vanish
above 5~GeV where data indicates agreement with the free nucleon
model. 
This suggests a cross section simply switching off, which is not
expected for a physical process.

  } 
  \label{fig:QEXSection_katori}
\end{figure}


% explain the different tufts weight components: Tufts2p2hWgt,
% TuftsWeight, fixInitState&XSec

Several changes were made to fix the limitations of the semi-empirical
model described above.
Figures~\ref{fig:tuftsWeight_hadE}, \ref{fig:tuftsWeight_muE} and
\ref{fig:tuftsWeight_nuE} show the effect of the adjustments made to
the simulation on the agreement between data and MC in the near
detector. Corresponding ratios of data over MC are shown in
Figures~\ref{fig:tuftsWeight_hadERatio}, \ref{fig:tuftsWeight_muERatio} and
\ref{fig:tuftsWeight_nuERatio}.  
First of all, weighting functions were used to correct the basic
2p2h-MEC cross section behaviour.  
The n-p initial state in GENIE is weighted up by a factor of four
while the n-n initial state is weight down by a factor of four.
The linear reduction of the cross section for 2p2h-MEC events is
corrected producing a flat cross section above 1~GeV. The effect of
these two adjustments on the energy distributions is shown by the
dotted blue histogram (labelled ``fixInitState\&XSec'') in the Figures.
The dotted green curve (labelled ``Tufts2p2hWgt'') shows the MC
distributions after the 2p2h cross section is reweighted as a function
of $q_0$ and $\vec{q}$. 
This is done using comparisons between the stock GENIE MEC events and
the quasi-elastic events.
Finally, the dotted magenta histogram (labelled ``TuftsWeight'') shows
the MC distributions after all the above adjustments are made in
combination with reweighting GENIE deep inelastic scattering with an
invariant mass $< 1.7~\text{GeV}$ down by 35\%.~\cite{tuftsWeightNote}

As mentioned above, the dotted magenta histogram in
Figures~\ref{fig:tuftsWeight_hadE}, \ref{fig:tuftsWeight_hadERatio},
\ref{fig:tuftsWeight_muE}, \ref{fig:tuftsWeight_muERatio},
\ref{fig:tuftsWeight_nuE} and \ref{fig:tuftsWeight_nuERatio} shows the
final MC distributions after the adjustments described above are
applied. 
Figure~\ref{fig:tuftsWeight_hadERatio} shows that the data/MC
ratio for the hadronic energy distribution is improved after the
inclusion of 2p2h events along with the combination of
adjustments. However, there is still a large discrepency between the
near detector data and MC in the range $1 - 2.5~\text{GeV}$. This
means that the hadronic component of events will be worse resolved for
higher values of hadronic energy. 
Figure~\ref{fig:tuftsWeight_muERatio} shows the data/MC ratio for muon
energy. Before including MEC (red histogram) MC generally
underestimates the event counts for each muon energy bin, particularly
in the range $1-3~\text{GeV}$. After including the 2p2h events and
making the adjustments (dotted magenta histogram) the MC
underestimates the event count below about 1~GeV, close to matches the
data between 1 and $1.5~\text{GeV}$, and overestimates the event count
per bin above $1.5~\text{GeV}$.
Figure~\ref{fig:tuftsWeight_nuERatio} shows the data/MC ratio for
neutrino energy. Compared to the simulation excluding 2p2h (red
histogram), the addition of 2p2h along with the adjustments 
improves the data/MC ratio below $1.75~\text{GeV}$ and in the range
$3.5 - 4~\text{GeV}$. However, the ratio worsens the in the range
$2 - 3.5~\text{GeV}$.

\section{Evaluation of Systematic Uncertainties}\label{sec:systs}

For the second muon neutrino disappearance analysis the effect of
systematic uncertainties on the neutrino, muon and hadronic energy
distributions were studied and quantified in terms of shifts to the
mean and integral after applying the
appropriate systematic shift to the simulation.
Monte Carlo samples were created with systematic shifts or alternative
physics models (such as noise modelling) applied before the
reconstruction stage of the simulation production.
A summary of the percentage shifts in hadronic energy, muon energy,
neutrino energy and normalisation due to each of the systematic
samples is shown in Table~\ref{tab:systShiftsPercentDiff}. 

The impact of systematic
uncertainties in the GENIE model and beam intensity effects
were studied in~\cite{VladGENIE} and~\cite{BrunoIntensity}
respectively. The intensity effect uncertainty is defined, by the
uncertainty in the number of events per beam spill, as no more than a
0.7\% normalisation shift in the near detector. 

Later in the analysis when performing the fit, the systematic shifts
to the hadron energy, muon energy, neutrino energy and normalisation
will be used to account for each source of uncertainty. 
The systematic shifts to the energy variables and normalisation is 
accounted for in the oscillation analysis by creating additional
muon neutrino energy histograms (for each detector) for each possible
combination of systematic shifts in mean or normalisation applied to
the variables before filling.  
When performing the fit the histogram formed from the combination of
systematic shifts that produces the lowest $\chi^2$, at each
point in the oscillation parameter space, is used.

\subsection{Calibration}\label{sec:calibsysts}

The data/MC ratios of calibrated muon energy as a function of distance
from the cell centres are used to define calibration shape
systematics for the x and y-view cells independently. 
The y-view cells display the most extreme disagreement between data and
MC in terms of calibrated response along the cells. In comparison the
disagreement between data and MC in the x-view cells is negligible and
is currently neglected in the analysis of systematics~\cite{dianaAbsCal}.

A comparison of proton energy in the data and MC is
used to define an uncertainty of $\pm 5\%$  for the energy scale of
hadronic showers~\cite{SusanProtondEdxCalib}. 
The effect of the 5\% calibration uncertainty is evaluated using MC
samples generated with a $+$5\% or $-$5\% shift applied, these samples
are referred to as the ``XY'' shifted samples.
The effect of the calibration uncertainty along the length of the
y-view cells was analysed using a MC sample generated with a
functional shift to the calibration of hits in the y-view cells, this
sample is referred to as the ``Y-func.'' shifted sample.
The shift in hadron, muon and neutrino energy for each sample was
analysed in~\cite{LukeCalibSystAna}.

Distributions of the hadronic energy, muon energy, neutrino energy and 
reconstructed minus true over true neutrino energy are shown for the
near detector ``XY'', near detector ``Y-func.'', far
detector ``XY'' and far detector ``Y-func.'' shifted samples in
Figures~\ref{fig:systsNDXY}, \ref{fig:systsNDY}, \ref{fig:systsFDXY}
and \ref{fig:systsFDY} respectively. 
For each plot shown in the Figures the standard baseline simulation is
shown for comparison.  
In both detectors the ``XY'' shifted sample causes a larger shift
(compared to the ``Y-func.'' sample) to
the mean {hadronic, muon and neutrino} energy and the normalisation as
can be seen in
Table~\ref{tab:systShiftsPercentDiff}.~\cite{LukeCalibSystAna} 
The table shows that the shifts in the near and far detector
normalisation due to the calibration uncertainty samples (``XY'' and
``Y-func.'') are anti-correlated.

\subsection{Birks}\label{sec:birkssysts}

Generally, the observed light yield from a scintillant is proportional
to the energy loss rate of the through going particle, dE/dx. 
However, at high energies the light yield is no longer proportional to
the energy loss rate. 
At higher energies the light yield, L, is given by

\begin{equation}
L \propto \dfrac{ \dfrac{dE}{dx} }{ 1 + k_B\dfrac{dE}{dx} +
  k_C\left(\dfrac{dE}{dx}\right)^2 } ,
\end{equation}

where $k_B$ and $k_C$ are Birks' constant and a higher order
correction constant respectively~\cite{chou1952nature}.

A fit of Birks' formula to the near detector data defines
the constants for the standard NOvA simulation. The fit to the data
yielded $k_B=0.04~\text{cm / MeV}$  and
$k_C=-0.0005~\text{cm}^2 / \text{MeV}^2$~\cite{danBirksTuneCheck}. 
These values for the constants are not consistent with those often
found in the literature and so two systematic samples (called Birks' B
and Birks' C) were created with the constants set to alternative
values to evaluate the effect of the uncertainty in the Birks
parameters on the systematic uncertainty of the analyses. 

The Birks' B sample files are created using values commonly found in
the literature, 
$k_B=0.01~\text{cm / MeV}$  and $k_C=-0.0~\text{cm}^2/\text{MeV}^2$. 
The Birks' C sample files are created using values approximately
halfway between the standard NOvA constants and the Birks' B
constants, $k_B=0.02~\text{cm / MeV}$  and
$k_C=-0.0~\text{cm}^2/ \text{MeV}^2$. 

Plots of hadronic energy, muon energy, neutrino energy and
reconstructed minus true over true energy are shown in
Figures~\ref{fig:systsNDBirks} and \ref{fig:systsFDBirks}
for the near detector and far detector respectively. For both
detectors the shift due to the Birks' B sample is larger than than the
shift for the Birks' C sample (see
Table~\ref{tab:systShiftsPercentDiff}).
This is to be expected as the Birks' C constants are halfway
between Birks' B and the standard simulation. 
The shifts found using the Birks' B sample are used to define the
systematic uncertainty due to the Birks' parameters for the second
analysis.

The study of the shifts in the hadronic, muon and neutrino energy were
carried out for the second muon neutrino disappearance
analysis~\cite{LukeBirksSystAna}. It was found that the Birks' B and C
sample files were created without the inclusion of rock
muons.
Rock muons are muons created by beam muon neutrinos
interacting with the rock upstream of the near detector. These rock
muons can then travel through the detector where they will generally
interact within at least one of the NOvA cells on the outer edge of
the detector and fail the containment selection.

%   muons can then travel through the detector where they will generally
%   interact within at least one of the NOvA cells on the outer edge of
%   the detector and fail the containment selection.}. 
Comparing the Birks' B and C samples to the nominal simulation
(which included rock muons) showed that there were approximately 10\%
more 
events per POT (protons on target) in the Birks' B and C
samples~\cite{LukeBirksSystAna}.

A study showed that the difference in
events/POT was due to more events in the standard simulation failing
containment~\cite{LukeRocks}. 
The favoured hypothesis for the reduction in events/POT is that
events including truly contained interactions are being over-layed
with rock muon energy deposits within the detector which causes
the event to fail containment~\cite{SASummary}.
For the study of the systematic uncertainty due to the Birks'
parameters a sample of the standard simulation was created that also
neglected to include rock muons.

\subsection{Noise}\label{sec:noisesysts}

The simulation of electronic noise within the NOvA avalanche photo
diodes is described in the the NOvA simulation
note~\cite{adamNOvASim}. 
The second disappearance analysis uses the initial noise model
(version 1)~\cite{SASummary}. 
A new optimised noise model has since been created (version 2). 
A sample of files were created with the new noise model and used to
approximately measure the systematic uncertainty due to the noise
model. 

Plots of hadronic energy, muon energy, neutrino energy and
reconstructed minus true over true are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:systsFDNoise}. The shifts in mean and normalisation
are shown in Table~\ref{tab:systShiftsPercentDiff}. 
The largest shift due to the new noise model is in the mean hadronic
energy ($+1.3\%$). The shift in mean neutrino energy and normalisation
are small compared to the other systematic samples analysed in this
section.~\cite{LukeNoiseSystAna}
