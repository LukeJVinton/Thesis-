%Introduce field of neutrino oscillation experiments
The neutrino was discovered a little over 60 years ago and during the
last two decades the ability of neutrinos to change flavour in flight
has been established beyond doubt.   
The Standard Model of particle physics defines neutrinos to be
massless. However, neutrino oscillations in vacuum requires that at
least one of the neutrinos has a mass. This means that the current
the model is incomplete and neutrino oscillations are beyond the
Standard Model.

%Introduce the NOvA experiment
Neutrino oscillation experiments such as NOvA aim to measure 
the probability of a neutrino oscillating from one flavour to another
and the rate of the oscillation. Such measurements probe the neutrino
mixing angles and the difference between the squared neutrino masses. 

the neutrino mixing parameters and the difference between
